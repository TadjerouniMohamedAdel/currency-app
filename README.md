## Why i Cound't finish this test

i taked the chalange to build the 2 small app into 2 days , but i was little perfectionist on the first so it costs me a lot of time, secound reason that i consumed all the api calls in the 2 api so i coudn't finish without api, my big mistake it was refetching currencies while I could store them into a context or simple redux store(without using middleware)
the conversion currency works but the chart still with mock data
